# Bitcoin Price Prediction with Real-Time Dashboard

An advanced real-time dashboard application for predicting Bitcoin prices and technical indicators using state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models.

## Features

### Real-Time Data Display
- Fetches real-time Bitcoin market data from Binance API.
- Displays candlestick charts for Bitcoin prices.

### Technical Indicator Calculation
- Computes various technical indicators: SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, ADX, ATR, CCI, OBV, MFI, and Stochastics.
- Integrates these indicators for enhanced decision-making.

### Price and Indicator Prediction
- Utilizes multiple machine learning and deep learning models for predicting future prices and indicators:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
  - **DNN (Deep Neural Network)**
- Trains models on historical data and saves trained models for future use.

### Ensemble Learning
- Combines predictions from multiple models to enhance robustness and accuracy.

### Feature Engineering
- Incorporates multiple features to improve prediction quality.
- Handles missing values with advanced filling techniques.

### Market Sentiment Data
- Integrates market sentiment data from Alternative.me API (Fear & Greed Index).

### User Interface
- Built with `tkinter` for an interactive user interface.
- Displays predictions and indicators on matplotlib charts.
- Auto-updates every 60 seconds to reflect new market data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `ccxt`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `ta`, `requests`, `matplotlib`, `tensorflow`, `scikit-learn`, `joblib`, `tkinter`

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bitcoin-price-prediction.git
   cd bitcoin-price-prediction
